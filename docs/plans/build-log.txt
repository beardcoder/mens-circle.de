Docker Image Build Results:
- Image: typo3-frankenphp-test
- Size: 928MB
- Status: Build completed successfully

Image Layer Breakdown:
- Base FrankenPHP image: ~240MB
- PHP extensions (imagemagick, gd, intl, etc.): ~352MB
- Composer vendor dependencies: 170MB
- Application code: 6.81MB
- Runtime tools (git, unzip, wget): 9.05MB
- Frontend assets: 733KB
- Composer binary: 3.14MB

Notes:
- Fixed user issue: Changed from 'caddy' to 'www-data' user (FrankenPHP Alpine uses www-data)
- Image size is larger than initially estimated (180-220MB) due to:
  * ImageMagick and development libraries
  * Full TYPO3 vendor dependencies
  * This is expected for a production-ready TYPO3 installation
