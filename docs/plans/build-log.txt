Docker Image Build Results:
- Image: typo3-frankenphp-test
- Size: 928MB
- Status: Build completed successfully

Image Layer Breakdown:
- Base FrankenPHP image: ~240MB
- PHP extensions (imagemagick, gd, intl, etc.): ~352MB
- Composer vendor dependencies: 170MB
- Application code: 6.81MB
- Runtime tools (git, unzip, wget): 9.05MB
- Frontend assets: 733KB
- Composer binary: 3.14MB

Notes:
- Fixed user issue: Changed from 'caddy' to 'www-data' user (FrankenPHP Alpine uses www-data)
- Image size is larger than initially estimated (180-220MB) due to:
  * ImageMagick and development libraries
  * Full TYPO3 vendor dependencies
  * This is expected for a production-ready TYPO3 installation

Build completed with DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
Container test successful: Wed Nov 12 21:38:20 CET 2025
- Container started and FrankenPHP initialized successfully
- HTTP endpoints responding with correct security headers
- No critical errors in logs (only expected warnings about TLS being disabled for HTTP-only mode)
- Health check failing as expected (TYPO3 requires database connection for /typo3/login endpoint)
- FrankenPHP version: PHP 8.4.14 with 32 threads

Test Results:
- Container Status: Running (unhealthy - expected without database)
- HTTP Response (root): 404 with proper security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- HTTP Response (typo3): 404 with proper security headers
- Server Header: Caddy (FrankenPHP integrated)
- Logs: Clean startup, no fatal/error messages

Warnings Found (non-critical):
- Caddyfile formatting warning (cosmetic only)
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 skipped (requires TLS - expected for development)
- Admin endpoint disabled (as configured)

Container cleaned up successfully.
Full stack test successful: Wed Nov 12 21:42:10 CET 2025
- All services started healthy
- Database connection working
- Redis connection working
- TYPO3 accessible via HTTP
